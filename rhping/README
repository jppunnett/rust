# rhping

HTTP Ping written in Rust.

Accepts a URL to "ping". Under the hood, rhping issues a HEAD request to the 
supplied URL and reports how long it takes to get a response.

Use like this:

	rhping url [timeout]

The optional timeout flag specifies how long rhping should wait for a response
until giving up. The timeout is specified in milliseconds. If timeout isn't
specified, the default is 500ms.
